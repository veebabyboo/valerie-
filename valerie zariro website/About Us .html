    <h1 style="tomato;">HISTORY</h1>
    <p> The Biomedical Engineering Workshop was established in 2023 with a clear mission to transform biomedical education from passive learning into active exploration.<br> 
        It began as a small initiative focused on giving students hands-on experience with real lab techniques especially in spectrophotometry, designing  and biochemical experimentation.
</p>
    <h2 style="tomato;">PURPOSE AND VISION</h2>
    <p2>Our Biomedical Engineering Workshop is designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice in the life sciences.
        <br>Our vision is to see students gain confidence in designing and interpreting experiments.
