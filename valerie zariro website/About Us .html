  <h1>HISTORY</h1>
  <p>The Biomedical Engineering Workshop was established in 2023 with a clear mission to transform biomedical education from passive learning into active exploration.
  It began as a small initiative focused on giving students hands-on experience with real lab techniques, especially in spectrophotometry, design, and biochemical experimentation.</p>

  <h2>PURPOSE AND VISION</h2>
  <p>Our Biomedical Engineering Workshop is designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice in the life sciences. Our vision is to see students gain confidence in designing and interpreting experiments.</p>

  <h3>WHO SHOULD ATTEND</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Undergraduate students in biomedical engineering and biomedical sciences</li>
    <li>Graduate students who are innovative and ready to change the world</li>
    <li>Lab technicians who want to acquire knowledge</li>
    <li>Individuals who are eager to learn how biology and technology converge</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>LOCATION</h4>
  <p>The venue for the workshop is the University of Zimbabwe. It will commence on 1 October and run to 3 October 2025.</p>
